{"name":"Deep Learning for Humanity and Medicine","briefIntro":"For Medical Professionals interested in improving their medical analysis using Deep learning tools","fullBio":"Hi!\n\nI am a Computer Science undergrad student, and a Data Scientist and am currently building a deep learning application to help medical professionals perform medical image analysis, by simplifying the workflow. \n\nSpecifically, the application works by accepting an image input and predicting any health problems inferred from the medical image. Currently, I would like to gain insight from the medical community on designing the features implemented within the application such as:\n\n* Which type of imaging would you most likely want to analyze and predict a disease/feature using this tool (such as X-rays, retinal photographs, CT scans, MRI, photographs of patient&#x27;s skin etc.)\n\n* Would you use this tool as a learning application, or as an advisory/helper application on real patient data.\n\n* How would the prevalence of such image analysis tool determine the future of the healthcare industry?\n\nIn order to obtain your valuable inputs and sign up to participate in the upcoming alpha version of the software, please fill out the google form here:  [Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdtiBknS4OWv3pQW9eBex2sGoSUKO_PZzM4DL5Q7ixM4JeLQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)","links":[{"linkType":"linkedin","linkLabel":"Checkout my LinkedIn Page","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritabratamaiti/","isImportant":true}],"avatarUrl":"images/avatar.png"}
