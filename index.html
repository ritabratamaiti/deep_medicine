                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am a Computer Science undergrad student, and a Data Scientist and am currently building a deep learning application to help medical professionals perform medical image analysis, by simplifying the workflow. </p>
<p>Specifically, the application works by accepting an image input and predicting any health problems inferred from the medical image. Currently, I would like to gain insight from the medical community on designing the features implemented within the application such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which type of imaging would you most likely want to analyze and predict a disease/feature using this tool (such as X-rays, retinal photographs, CT scans, MRI, photographs of patient&#x27;s skin etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Would you use this tool as a learning application, or as an advisory/helper application on real patient data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How would the prevalence of such image analysis tool determine the future of the healthcare industry?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to obtain your valuable inputs and sign up to participate in the upcoming alpha version of the software, please fill out the google form here:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdtiBknS4OWv3pQW9eBex2sGoSUKO_PZzM4DL5Q7ixM4JeLQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Form</a></p>
